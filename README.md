# Ping-Pong Game

This game was created with the aim of studying video game development. 
The project is straightforward and primarily focused on exploring rendering processes 
and computer graphics. No pre-made game engines were used in its creationâ€”instead, 
a custom engine was developed from scratch specifically for this game.
